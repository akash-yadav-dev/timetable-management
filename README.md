## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### Option 1 — Quick Start (Using Tailwind CDN)

If you’re using the Tailwind CDN (uncommented in your HTML):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>


Option 2 — Optimized Build (Recommended)
To generate a compiled CSS with only the classes you use:


Install Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init



Update tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./*.html", "./js/**/*.js"],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
};



Create input file
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;



Build your final stylesheet
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./style.css --minify



Run the project


Open index.html in any browser.
